Testing for QIPSClient
sjh1024 1-4-19

The following is a list of hand-done tests that should be run through upon significant changes to the QIPS Client.
Please conduct them to ensure functionality is not lost upon updates.

1. Adds to all ipsets are successful to database AND ipset.
*Make sure statistics are updated correctly. 
2. Removals from all ipsets are successful to database AND ipset.
*Make sure statistics are updated correctly.
3. Moves between all ipsets are successful...
	* spamhaus->honeypot
	* spamhaus->user-defined
	* spamhaus->unh
	* honeypot->spamhaus
	* honeypot->user-defined
	* honeypot->unh
	* user-defined->spamhaus
	* user-defined->honeypot
	* user-defined->unh
	* unh->user-defined
	* unh->spamhaus
	* unh->honeypot
*Make sure statistics are being updated correctly
4. Renewals are successful in:
	* spamhaus
	* honeypot
	* unh
	* user-defined
5. Whitelist IPs will fail to add
	*CRaTER
	*Blackstar
	*assessment-agent
	*spork/protocore
	*Applecore
	*ron.sr.unh.edu (2)
	*UNH Wireless
	*UNH Mail Servers
	*RCC Routers
	*RCC HIDS
	*The Internet
*Statistics should not change
*Database should not change
*ipset should not change
*Test with all ipsets:
	*spamhaus
	*honeypot
	*user-defined
	*unh

6. Scrolling still works as intended
	* scroll up a bit from current position each time a new entry appears, sort of like they're "stacking" up.
7. Duplicate adds do not persist in the database
	* spamhaus
	* honeypot
	* unh
	* user-defined
	NOTE: ipset will not allow duplicate addresses, so you don't need to check ipset tables in this step.
